# xyzzwhy

A Clojure-powered Twitter bot who goes on random adventures through a
dreamlike world. (Although, currently, xyzzwhy isn't yet posting to Twitter.)

## Installation

Make sure you have leiningen installed. Clone the repo and run it from the
repl and then repeatedly issue (-main) to see random events. Or you can run it via 'lein repl'.

## Current Status

Very basic and completely random for now. Future plans (roughly in order):

- Get xyzzwhy tweeting.
- Maintain xyzzwhy's state: health, inventory, and so forth.
- Create consistency in the adventure.
- Procedurally-generated 'dungeons' rather than just randomized events.
- Make it funny (or at least interesting).

### Ongoing

- Add more data. Tons more data.
