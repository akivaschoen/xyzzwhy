# xyzzwhy

A Clojure-powered Twitter bot who goes on random adventures through a dreamlike world. Inspired by the Infocom text adventures of yore with an unhealthy dose of paranoia and gentle schizophrenia.

# NOTE AND/OR WARNING

The dev branch is currently in a completely unusable state as I re-write the app and the supporting corpus from the ground up. Potential talent scouts, check the 'dev' branch for an example of my current ability with Clojure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. `lein uberjar`
3. Either `lein run` or `java -jar target/uberjar/xyzzwhy-*.jar`

You'll need to use Twitter's developer's tools to get an app going. This is done [here](https://apps.twitter.com) and is beyond the scope of this document.

## Current Status

xyzzwhy has been going strong on Twitter since November 2014. You can get a taste of what he's currently capable of [here](https://twitter.com/xyzzwhy).
